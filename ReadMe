PREFACE

This distribution features the Perl 5 module named "Locale::KeyedText"; see the
file lib/Locale/KeyedText.pm for the main documentation, which is in POD
format.  The distribution also includes a ChangeLog file to say what changes
already happened, and a TODO file to say what changes have yet to happen.  The
file INSTALL should help with installation issues.  Read below for how to get
support or keep up to date, know this distribution's dependencies, or read the
credits or copyright and license.

KEEPING UP TO DATE

My module set is constantly under development.  You should be able to find the
newest versions at my website, "http://www.DarrenDuncan.net", on the page called
"Perl Libraries I Made" (name subject to change).  They can also be found on CPAN
under the author name of "DUNCAND".  

I am inclined to update the copies on my web site more often, but those
intermediate versions are more likely to have been tested less, and the modules
may be updated day by day without increasing the version numbers.  However, the
copies on CPAN are guaranteed to have unique version numbers when the module has
changed.

DEPENDENCIES

Perl Version: 5.008001

Core Modules:

	Test::More 0.47 (but only for the test suite)

Non-Core Modules: none

SUPPORT

Currently I don't have any support arranged with other people, lists, newsgroups,
or otherwise.  Feel free to ask me if you can't figure things out on your own, or
another person whom you know has used this.  I may start a mailing list for 
support issues later, so that users of my modules can help each other with them.

CREDITS

Besides myself as the creator ...

* 2004.07.26 - Thanks to Jason Martin (jhmartin@toger.us) for suggesting a
feature, along with providing sample usage and patch code, that supports
embedding of Template class packages in the same files as program code, rather
than requiring separate files.

* 2005.03.21 - Thanks to Stevan Little (stevan@iinteractive.com) for feedback
towards improving this module's documentation, particularly towards using a much
shorter SYNOPSIS, so that it is easier for newcomers to understand the module at
a glance, and not be intimidated by large amounts of detailed information.
