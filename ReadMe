PREFACE

This distribution features the Perl 5 module named "Locale::KeyedText"; see the
file lib/Locale/KeyedText.pm for the main documentation, which is in POD
format.  The distribution also includes a ChangeLog file to say what changes
already happened, and a TODO file to say what changes have yet to happen.  The
file INSTALL should help with installation issues.  Read below for how to get
support or keep up to date, know this distribution's dependencies, or read the
credits or copyright and license.

KEEPING UP TO DATE

My module set is constantly under development.  You should be able to find the
newest versions at my website, "http://www.DarrenDuncan.net", on the page called
"Perl Libraries I Made" (name subject to change).  They can also be found on CPAN
under the author name of "DUNCAND".  

I am inclined to update the copies on my web site more often, but those
intermediate versions are more likely to have been tested less, and the modules
may be updated day by day without increasing the version numbers.  However, the
copies on CPAN are guaranteed to have unique version numbers when the module has
changed.

DEPENDENCIES

Perl Version: 5.006

This module doesn't require anything else.

SUPPORT

Currently I don't have any support arranged with other people, lists, newsgroups,
or otherwise.  Feel free to ask me if you can't figure things out on your own, or
another person whom you know has used this.  I may start a mailing list for 
support issues later, so that users of my modules can help each other with them.

CREDITS

None besides myself so far.
