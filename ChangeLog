	* Release 1.01_1.

	* This distribution now requires Perl 5.008001 or higher; it was 5.006.

	* All files in this distribution are now officially UTF-8 encoded, though
	they continue to have no BOM, and they still have Unix line-breaks.  Any
	files that contain code now have the "use utf8" pragma.  Any files that
	contain POD now have "=encoding utf8" as the first POD command paragraph.

	* All distro files that contain code, whether *.[pm|pl|PL|t], now begin with
	"#!perl" on their first line, and the second line contains "use 5.008001;
	use utf8; use strict; use warnings;"; all other code and POD is below those.
	Within the *.pm files, the "package ... $VERSION ..." now appears above all
	of the POD; also, the NAME and DEPENDENCIES POD now have nothing between
	them.  Within the *.t files, there is no longer any BEGIN/END $loaded test,
	so the test count has been decremented by one.

	* Updated any TODO module references to be L<>.

	* New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.01_1.

	* Fixed a minor SYNOPSIS code bug in KeyedText.pm.

	* Release 1.00.

	* New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.00.

	* I hereby assert that Locale::KeyedText is complete, tested, and ready to
	be used in production environments.  No further updates are planned during
	the short term except in response to user requests.  Any future releases
	should be fully backwards-compatible with this release.

	* Any other changes to this distribution since v0.07, aside from the
	version change and the truncation of this ChangeLog file, follow below.

	* In KeyedText.pm, minor updates to the DESCRIPTION and SEE ALSO docs.

	* Updated the TODO file.

	* Locale-KeyedText-0.07, the last version of the distribution prior to the
	official registration of Locale::KeyedText on the Perl 5 Module List, was
	released on CPAN.

2004-01-15   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Locale-KeyedText-0.01, the first version of any distribution to contain
	Locale::KeyedText, was released on CPAN.

2003-09-29   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Began active code development on the prophecied Locale::KeyedText module.

	* Module based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

2000-05-17 thru 2003-09-26

	* Worked on precursor code and documentation, some posted on CPAN, which
	described an upcoming new module to make it easy to separate human-readable
	messages from code; some details were published in 'Rosetta::Framework'.
