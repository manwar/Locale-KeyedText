	* Release 0.05.

	* This is a feature addition release; it is completely backwards compatible.

	* Updated KeyedText.pm (now v0.05) to add a new feature to
	Translator.translate_message() so that it first tests to see if a TEMPLATE
	class package is already loaded before trying to load it with "require". 
	As a result of this change, Locale::KeyedText should now work for
	situations where you want to embed Template class package declarations in
	your standard code files, rather than in separate files of their own.  Also
	added new POD section AN ALTERNATIVE TO SEPARATED TEMPLATE FILES.  Thanks
	to Jason Martin (jhmartin@toger.us) for suggesting the new feature.  Also 
	added 4 more tests to Locale_KeyedText.t, for a total of 102.

	* Release 0.04.

	* This is a small code bug fix release.  No POD or API changes were made.

	* Updated KeyedText.pm (now v0.04) to fix Message.as_string() and
	Translator.translate_message() so that each outputs interpolated message
	key values of zero as '0' and not ''.  Also updated 4 tests in
	Locale_KeyedText.t to confirm that the bugs were fixed.

	* Note that KeyedText 0.03 would fail 2 of the current 98 tests.

	* Release 0.03.

	* This is a small but incompatible maintenance release.  Or more
	specifically, it is only incompatible if your use of it involves reading
	the package names, such as with "UNIVERSAL::isa" (and the tests do); if you
	don't do that, then it is backwards compatible.

	* Updated lib/Locale/KeyedText.pm (now v0.03) to reorganize and more
	properly document its component class/package set. 
	Locale::KeyedText::_::Message was renamed to Locale::KeyedText::Message and
	Locale::KeyedText::_::Translator was renamed to
	Locale::KeyedText::Translator.  The stateless new_message() and
	new_translator() functions were each moved into the packages of the objects
	that they create, and each was renamed to new(), and each now uses its
	first argument as the package name to bless into as is usual with Perl
	classes, and unlike the hard-coded bless it had before; two new functions
	having the old names now exist in their place and simply call the moved
	functions, so you can still invoke them like you did before.

	* Added new POD documentation section CLASSES IN THIS MODULE to
	KeyedText.pm which outlines the reality of the multiple package/classes in
	the single module, and their relation.  It also says that you should never
	make your own modules with any of the same package or module names.

	* The multiple package declarations in KeyedText.pm are no longer
	obfuscated (split over 2 lines each) to prevent PAUSE from indexing them.

	* Updated t/Locale_KeyedText.t so the correct class names are tested for.

	* No other files were changed.

2004-01-18   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Release 0.02.

	* This is a small bug fix release.

	* Added 2 more tests to Locale_KeyedText.t (for 98 total) that check for
	correct behaviour when Message Variables are given undefined hash values;
	the tests would produce warnings when run against release 0.01.

	* Made a couple small code updates to Locale::KeyedText, and incremented
	its version from 0.01 to 0.02.  Updated the methods Message->as_string()
	and Translator->translate_message() to substitute "" for any undefined
	Message variable values when building their output strings; now the 2 new
	tests will not throw warnings.

	* Fixed a few small mistakes in, and made small changes to,
	Locale::KeyedText's POD.  SYNOPSIS had bug fixes.  DESCRIPTION and SEE ALSO
	had some small additions.  Other areas had indenting fixes.

2004-01-15   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Release 0.01.

	* This is the initial release of Locale::KeyedText.  The module is feature
	complete and has complete POD documentation and a complete test suite.  The
	module is officially in beta development status, but should move quickly to
	Released status once it starts getting used in production.  The module is 
	licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License Version 2.1.

	* This distribution is the first one that I am creating with MakeMaker's 
	"make dist" command; previously I used "tar -cz ..." to make distros.

2003-09-29   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Began active code development on the prophecied Locale::KeyedText module.

	* Module based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

2000-05-17 thru 2003-09-26

	* Worked on precursor to, and CPAN release versions of, modules such as
	'Rosetta' and 'SQL::SyntaxModel', which as part of their functioning may
	generate human-readable messages, such as for error conditions.  While
	working on these, it was intended to create a proper separation of the
	human-readable text from the code, and that text would go in one or more of
	its own files, with a separate version for each human language (such as
	with Mac OS X localized resource files).  A module dedicated to making this
	task easy was to be developed and called 'Locale::KeyedText'.  Some design
	details were thought up and included in the 'Rosetta' distribution file
	'Rosetta::Framework'.  It will be released independantly, due to its 
	expected usefulness outside of the aforementioned database modules.
