	* Locale-KeyedText Release 1.03.

	* New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.03.

	* Added new external dependency on Test::More v0.47 (bundled with Perl
	5.8.x); this distribution's test suite has been re-factored to use it rather
	than rolling its own equivalent functionality, which is more in line with
	CPAN best practices.  The new dependency does not extend to this
	distribution's core modules (everything in /lib), which do not use it.

	* Updated every 'use' statement in this distribution so that the module
	version is formatted as a number rather than a string; this fixes a problem
	where Perl was not asserting that the installed modules were new enough.

	* In order to help ease the transition to Perl 6, updated every in-code
	function and method which made direct references to @_ elements so that they
	explicitly declare argument variables instead with "my (...) = @_;";
	moreover, any functions that don't use their invocant use "undef" for it in
	the above list.  These 6 KeyedText.pm code routines were affected:
	new_message(), new_translator(), Message.get_message_[key|variables](),
	Translator.get_template_[set|member]_names().  Also, every in-code (test
	suite) or in-POD (KeyedText.pm) Template class declaration was affected.

	* Multiple KeyedText.pm POD updates: 1. Wrote a brand new and much shorter
	SYNOPSIS, which should be much easier to learn quickly than the old one; 2.
	Renamed the old SYNOPSIS to EXAMPLE PROGRAM WITH ENTIRELY SEPARATED TEMPLATE
	MODULE FILES and moved it further down; 3. Wrote a brand new and much more
	accessible DESCRIPTION that should be much more suited to explaining the
	benefits and purpose of the module; 4. Renamed the old DESCRIPTION to HOW IT
	WORKS, moved it further down, and edited it a bit more; 5. Renamed AN
	ALTERNATIVE TO SEPARATED TEMPLATE FILES to ALTERNATE EXAMPLE PROGRAM WITH
	MOSTLY INTEGRATED TEMPLATE MODULES; 6. Demoted all the =head2 in the 2
	EXAMPLE sections to ordinary one-line paragraphs and reduced whitespace.

	* Added a dated credit notice to Stevan Little in the ReadMe and
	KeyedText.pm; also copied an older credit notice to Jason Martin from the
	ReadMe to KeyedText.pm, adding dates; now credits are in both files.  In 
	KeyedText.pm, these live in a new POD section called CREDITS.

	* Stripped this ChangeLog of release entries that were specific to its
	separately distributed Perl 6 version (in Perl6-Pugs), dated 2005-03-07 thru
	2005-03-13; those details will appear in the ChangeLog of a separate
	distribution of my own that contains just my Perl 6 modules.

	* NOTICE: This release v1.03 is the last one to contain detailed ChangeLog
	entries for releases v1.00 thru v1.03; release v1.04 will truncate the
	ChangeLog so it only shows details for v1.04 and later.

	* Locale-KeyedText Release 1.02.

	* New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.02.

	* This release primarily fixes bugs or makes code style improvements in this
	current Perl 5 version that were simultaneously performed on the brand new
	Perl 6 version in time for its Pugs v6.0.11 release.

	* Corrected a few spelling mistakes in the KeyedText.pm documentation.

	* Corrected a couple bugs in Locale_KeyedText.t: 1. The last 3 tests contained 
	the wrong text in their output strings, suggesting that the last 4 all did the 
	same thing. 2. Removed the vis() function, which was never used.

	* In order to help ease the transition to Perl 6, updated every in-code (in
	the test suite) or in-POD (in KeyedText.pm) Template class declaration to
	make all user text message strings bound in non-interpolating single quotes
	rather than interpolating double-quotes.  The reason is because these text
	strings frequently use literal braces ({}) and Perl 6 would have incorrectly
	interpreted those as containing embedded Perl code to execute and
	interpolate the result value of.

	* Following a suggestion given to me by Larry Wall on p6l, replaced the
	input checking negative assertions in Message.new() and Translator.new()
	with positive assertions that do the same thing; for example, rather than
	testing the input for being either an empty string or containing bad
	characters, it tests that input consists entirely of one or more good
	character; the new versions are much more concise and easier to understand.

	* Following a style suggestion given to me by Larry Wall on p6l, updated
	every occurance of a "return" statement in the distribution to remove the
	parenthesis around its value list, since it is a an operator rather than a
	function; this also makes my code more consistent since I never used parens
	for the likes of "sort" or "keys" or "next" or "last".  Also updated every
	"return" to not explicitly return undefs (that's what "return" does by
	default), and also to not return a generic truth value ("1") when any caller
	would ignore it.

	* Updated any DEPENDENCIES documentation to use sub-headings "[|Non-] Core
	Modules" rather than "[|Non]standard Modules".

	* Updated the TODO file re supporting plain-text Template files.

2004-12-15   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Locale-KeyedText Release 1.01.

	* New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.01.

	* No further changes to distribution besides the version numbers.

2004-12-14   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Locale-KeyedText Release 1.01_2.

	* New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.01_2.

	* Updated the SYNOPSIS and AN ALTERNATIVE TO SEPARATED TEMPLATE FILES
	documentation in KeyedText.pm to add the character accents to the French
	language examples.  Those accents should have been there all along, but I
	didn't use them before v1.01 because ASCII didn't support them.  Also
	updated the BUGS documentation to remove the comment about missing accents.

	* Fixed a minor AN ALTERNATIVE TO SEPARATED TEMPLATE FILES code bug.

2004-12-13   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Locale-KeyedText Release 1.01_1.

	* This distribution now requires Perl 5.008001 or higher; it was 5.006.

	* All files in this distribution are now officially UTF-8 encoded, though
	they continue to have no BOM, and they still have Unix line-breaks.  Any
	files that contain code now have the "use utf8" pragma.  Any files that
	contain POD now have "=encoding utf8" as the first POD command paragraph.

	* All distro files that contain code, whether *.[pm|pl|PL|t], now begin with
	"#!perl" on their first line, and the second line contains "use 5.008001;
	use utf8; use strict; use warnings;"; all other code and POD is below those.
	Within the *.pm files, the "package ... $VERSION ..." now appears above all
	of the POD; also, the NAME and DEPENDENCIES POD now have nothing between
	them.  Within the *.t files, there is no longer any BEGIN/END $loaded test,
	so the test count has been decremented by one.

	* Updated any SEE ALSO module references to be L<>.

	* New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.01_1.

	* Fixed a minor SYNOPSIS code bug in KeyedText.pm.

2004-09-23   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Locale-KeyedText Release 1.00.

	* New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.00.

	* I hereby assert that Locale::KeyedText is complete, tested, and ready to
	be used in production environments.  No further updates are planned during
	the short term except in response to user requests.  Any future releases
	should be fully backwards-compatible with this release.

	* Any other changes to this distribution since v0.07, aside from the
	version change and the truncation of this ChangeLog file, follow below.

	* In KeyedText.pm, minor updates to the DESCRIPTION and SEE ALSO docs.

	* Updated the TODO file.

2004-09-23   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	The next version of the Module List will list the following module:

	  modid:       Locale::KeyedText
	  DSLIP:       RdpOl
	  description: Refer to user messages in programs by keys
	  userid:      DUNCAND (Darren Duncan)
	  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
	  enteredby:   KSTAR (Kurt D. Starsinic)
	  enteredon:   Thu Sep 23 18:35:01 2004 GMT

	The resulting entry will be:

	Locale::
	::KeyedText       RdpOl Refer to user messages in programs by keys   DUNCAND

	* Locale-KeyedText-0.07, the last version of the distribution prior to the
	official registration of Locale::KeyedText on the Perl 5 Module List, was
	released on CPAN.

2004-01-15   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Locale-KeyedText-0.01, the first version of any distribution to contain
	Locale::KeyedText, was released on CPAN.

2003-09-29   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Began active code development on the prophecied Locale::KeyedText module.

	* Module based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

2000-05-17 thru 2003-09-26

	* Worked on precursor code and documentation, some posted on CPAN, which
	described an upcoming new module to make it easy to separate human-readable
	messages from code; some details were published in 'Rosetta::Framework'.
