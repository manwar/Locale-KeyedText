	* Release 1.02.

	* New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.02.

	* This release primarily fixes bugs or makes code style improvements in this
	current Perl 5 version that were simultaneously performed on the brand new
	Perl 6 version, for the .

	* Corrected a few spelling mistakes in the KeyedText.pm documentation.

	* Corrected a couple bugs in Locale_KeyedText.t: 1. The last 3 tests contained 
	the wrong text in their output strings, suggesting that the last 4 all did the 
	same thing. 2. Removed the vis() function, which was never used.

	* In order to help ease the transition to Perl 6, updated every in-code (in
	the test suite) or in-POD (in KeyedText.pm) Template class declaration to
	make all user text message strings bound in non-interpolating single quotes
	rather than interpolating double-quotes.  The reason is because these text
	strings frequently use literal braces ({}) and Perl 6 would have incorrectly
	interpreted those as containing embedded Perl code to execute and
	interpolate the result value of.

	* Following a suggestion given to me by Larry Wall on p6l, replaced the
	input checking negative assertions in Message.new() and Translator.new()
	with positive assertions that do the same thing; for example, rather than
	testing the input for being either an empty string or containing bad
	characters, it tests that input consists entirely of one or more good
	character; the new versions are much more concise and easier to understand.

	* Following a style suggestion given to me by Larry Wall on p6l, updated
	every occurance of a "return" statement in the distribution to remove the
	parenthesis around its value list, since it is a an operator rather than a
	function; this also makes my code more consistent since I never used parens
	for the likes of "sort" or "keys" or "next" or "last".  Also updated every
	"return" to not explicitly return undefs (that's what "return" does by
	default), and also to not return a generic truth value ("1") when any caller
	would ignore it.

	* Updated any DEPENDENCIES documentation to use sub-headings "[|Non-] Core
	Modules" rather than "[|Non]standard Modules".

	* Updated the TODO file re supporting plain-text Template files.

	* Perl6-Pugs-6.0.11, the first version of any distribution to contain the
	Perl 6 version of Locale::KeyedText, was released on CPAN.  It lives under
	the /modules directory in that distribution.  This Perl 6 port has a release
	number of v0.0.1, and corresponds to the Perl 5 release number of v1.02.

2005-03-07 thru 2005-03-10

	* Created a new development branch of Locale::KeyedText that is written
	entirely in Perl 6 (rather than Perl 5), including the module proper, all of
	its POD, and its entire test suite; it matches the current mainline Perl 5
	distribution feature-wise.  This new Perl 6 version has been committed into
	the version control system (under /modules) for Autrijus Tang's new "Pugs"
	distribution, which will be the runtime engine that it runs under; later it
	will run under the "Parrot" engine.  The Perl 6 Locale::KeyedText is
	currently at version 0.0.1 and has not actually been executed yet, due to
	Pugs currently not supporting some of the Perl 6 language features that it
	needs; it probably contains a few bugs, and also may stand to be revised as
	the not yet finalized Perl 6 spec shifts underneath it.  The new LKT port
	can be used by the developers of Pugs as a feature integration test that
	helps them know they are implementing the Perl 6 spec correctly.

2004-12-15   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Release 1.01.

	* New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.01.

	* No further changes to distribution besides the version numbers.

2004-12-14   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Release 1.01_2.

	* New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.01_2.

	* Updated the SYNOPSIS and AN ALTERNATIVE TO SEPARATED TEMPLATE FILES
	documentation in KeyedText.pm to add the character accents to the French
	language examples.  Those accents should have been there all along, but I
	didn't use them before v1.01 because ASCII didn't support them.  Also
	updated the BUGS documentation to remove the comment about missing accents.

	* Fixed a minor AN ALTERNATIVE TO SEPARATED TEMPLATE FILES code bug.

2004-12-13   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Release 1.01_1.

	* This distribution now requires Perl 5.008001 or higher; it was 5.006.

	* All files in this distribution are now officially UTF-8 encoded, though
	they continue to have no BOM, and they still have Unix line-breaks.  Any
	files that contain code now have the "use utf8" pragma.  Any files that
	contain POD now have "=encoding utf8" as the first POD command paragraph.

	* All distro files that contain code, whether *.[pm|pl|PL|t], now begin with
	"#!perl" on their first line, and the second line contains "use 5.008001;
	use utf8; use strict; use warnings;"; all other code and POD is below those.
	Within the *.pm files, the "package ... $VERSION ..." now appears above all
	of the POD; also, the NAME and DEPENDENCIES POD now have nothing between
	them.  Within the *.t files, there is no longer any BEGIN/END $loaded test,
	so the test count has been decremented by one.

	* Updated any SEE ALSO module references to be L<>.

	* New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.01_1.

	* Fixed a minor SYNOPSIS code bug in KeyedText.pm.

2004-09-23   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Release 1.00.

	* New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.00.

	* I hereby assert that Locale::KeyedText is complete, tested, and ready to
	be used in production environments.  No further updates are planned during
	the short term except in response to user requests.  Any future releases
	should be fully backwards-compatible with this release.

	* Any other changes to this distribution since v0.07, aside from the
	version change and the truncation of this ChangeLog file, follow below.

	* In KeyedText.pm, minor updates to the DESCRIPTION and SEE ALSO docs.

	* Updated the TODO file.

2004-09-23   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	The next version of the Module List will list the following module:

	  modid:       Locale::KeyedText
	  DSLIP:       RdpOl
	  description: Refer to user messages in programs by keys
	  userid:      DUNCAND (Darren Duncan)
	  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
	  enteredby:   KSTAR (Kurt D. Starsinic)
	  enteredon:   Thu Sep 23 18:35:01 2004 GMT

	The resulting entry will be:

	Locale::
	::KeyedText       RdpOl Refer to user messages in programs by keys   DUNCAND

	* Locale-KeyedText-0.07, the last version of the distribution prior to the
	official registration of Locale::KeyedText on the Perl 5 Module List, was
	released on CPAN.

2004-01-15   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Locale-KeyedText-0.01, the first version of any distribution to contain
	Locale::KeyedText, was released on CPAN.

2003-09-29   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Began active code development on the prophecied Locale::KeyedText module.

	* Module based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

2000-05-17 thru 2003-09-26

	* Worked on precursor code and documentation, some posted on CPAN, which
	described an upcoming new module to make it easy to separate human-readable
	messages from code; some details were published in 'Rosetta::Framework'.
