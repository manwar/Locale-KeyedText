	* Release 0.02.

	* This is a small bug fix release.

	* Added 2 more tests to Locale_KeyedText.t (for 98 total) that check for
	correct behaviour when Message Variables are given undefined hash values;
	the tests would produce warnings when run against release 0.01.

	* Made a couple small code updates to Locale::KeyedText, and incremented
	its version from 0.01 to 0.02.  Updated the methods Message->as_string()
	and Translator->translate_message() to substitute "" for any undefined
	Message variable values when building their output strings; now the 2 new
	tests will not throw warnings.

	* Fixed a few small mistakes in, and made small changes to,
	Locale::KeyedText's POD.  SYNOPSIS had bug fixes.  DESCRIPTION and SEE ALSO
	had some small additions.  Other areas had indenting fixes.

	* Release 0.01.

	* This is the initial release of Locale::KeyedText.  The module is feature
	complete and has complete POD documentation and a complete test suite.  The
	module is officially in beta development status, but should move quickly to
	Released status once it starts getting used in production.  The module is 
	licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License Version 2.1.

	* This distribution is the first one that I am creating with MakeMaker's 
	"make dist" command; previously I used "tar -cz ..." to make distros.

	* Began active code development on the prophecied Locale::KeyedText module.

	* Module based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

2000-05-17 thru 2003-09-26

	* Worked on precursor to, and CPAN release versions of, modules such as
	'Rosetta' and 'SQL::SyntaxModel', which as part of their functioning may
	generate human-readable messages, such as for error conditions.  While
	working on these, it was intended to create a proper separation of the
	human-readable text from the code, and that text would go in one or more of
	its own files, with a separate version for each human language (such as
	with Mac OS X localized resource files).  A module dedicated to making this
	task easy was to be developed and called 'Locale::KeyedText'.  Some design
	details were thought up and included in the 'Rosetta' distribution file
	'Rosetta::Framework'.  It will be released independantly, due to its 
	expected usefulness outside of the aforementioned database modules.
