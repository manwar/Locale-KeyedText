----------------------------------------------------------------------

2005-09-12   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.6.1 (SVN r808).

    * New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm 1.6.0.

    * Updated all POD-containing files to re-wrap any non-indented POD
    paragraphs to a 75 character width, which is 5 less than the 80
    character width they were wrapped to before.  This change should make
    it easier to copy and paste a diff or patch of this documentation into
    an email message, where it is quoted at least once, without any line
    wrapping occurring.  Likewise, these standard documentation files were
    re-wrapped to 75 characters: ReadMe, INSTALL, LGPL|GPL, Changes, TODO.

    * Revised this Changes file to replace all detail entries for releases
    1.04 thru 1.6.0 with a significant release list for the same period;
    also added references to when all 'Rosetta developer release' (#s 1-3)
    were.

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.6.0 (SVN r787), containing
    Locale::KeyedText 1.6.0, was released on CPAN.  This is the first
    release of this distribution and its modules for which they had 3-part
    version numbers, rather than floating point version numbers.

    * These were the current versions cited by the public announcement for
    Rosetta/SQL-Routine developer release #3.

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.05, containing Locale::KeyedText 1.05, was

    its modules for which they had floating point version numbers, rather
    than 3-part version numbers.

2004-09-23   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 1.00, containing Locale::KeyedText 1.00, was
    released on CPAN.  This is the first release of this module following
    its official registration on the Perl 5 Module List.

2004-09-23   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    The next version of the Module List will list the following module:

      modid:       Locale::KeyedText
      DSLIP:       RdpOl
      description: Refer to user messages in programs by keys
      userid:      DUNCAND (Darren Duncan)
      chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
      enteredby:   KSTAR (Kurt D. Starsinic)
      enteredon:   Thu Sep 23 18:35:01 2004 GMT

    The resulting entry will be:

    Locale::
    ::KeyedText       RdpOl Refer to user messages in programs by keys   DUNCAND

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 0.07, containing Locale::KeyedText 0.07, was
    released on CPAN.  This is the last release of this module prior to its
    official registration on the Perl 5 Module List.

2004-08-05   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 0.06, containing Locale::KeyedText 0.06, was
    released on CPAN.

    * These were the current versions cited by the public announcement for
    Rosetta/SQL-SyntaxModel developer release #1.

2004-01-15   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Locale-KeyedText Release 0.01, containing Locale::KeyedText 0.01, was
    released on CPAN.  This is the first release of any distribution to
    contain Locale::KeyedText.  This is the first release of any
    distribution for which some of the existing work that became the
    Locale-KeyedText distribution was in the form of executable code, and
    not just design documentation.

2003-09-29   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Began active code development on the proposed Locale::KeyedText
    module.

    * Module based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

2003-06-03   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.11 was released on CPAN.  This is the first release
    of any distribution where the proposal documentation for
    Locale::KeyedText uses that name for it; it was renamed from
    Rosetta::Locale.

2003-05-28   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.10 was released on CPAN.  This is the last release
    of any distribution for which the documented name of the proposed
    module that became Locale::KeyedText was given the name
    Rosetta::Locale.

2003-03-04   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Rosetta Release 0.05 was released on CPAN.  This is the first release
    of any distribution to contain design documentation that became the
    Locale-KeyedText distribution, specifically in the STRUCTURE and BRIEF
    MODULE LIST portions of the documentation file Rosetta::Framework.  It
    described an upcoming new module to make it easy to separate
    human-readable messages from code, intending that each user language
    can have their own separate human text file.  The proposed core module
    name is Rosetta::Locale.

    * Given that I started publishing details about what became
    Locale::KeyedText here, 2003 is the start of my declared copyright date
    range for Locale::KeyedText.
