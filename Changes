	* Locale-KeyedText Release 1.04.

	* New code file versions are: KeyedText.pm v1.04.

	* Updated every instance of the COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE documentation in this
	distribution to correct the declared date range in which the core
	Locale::KeyedText files were created.  The new dates are 2003 thru 2005,
	which is when I actually committed documentation describing or code
	implementing what became the Locale::KeyedText core.  The old dates were
	1999 thru 2005, which goes back to the time that I started conceiving a
	larger project which the aforementioned module started out being related to;
	however, those earlier years did not contain any work on what specifically
	became the aforementioned module, so they are now excluded.

	* Updated every instance of the COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE documentation in this
	distribution so that you may now choose between licensing it under the LGPL
	version 2.1 or any later LGPL version, rather than only under version 2.1.

	* Renamed the "LICENSE" file to "LGPL", and correspondingly updated all
	references to it in this distribution, most of them being in COPYRIGHT AND
	LICENSE statements.  This change was made to reduce user confusion in
	situations where files from this distribution may be aggregated with other
	files that have different licenses; the old name was too generic.

	* This release saw a large reorganization of the test suite.  The file
	t/Locale_KeyedText.t was split-up into these 5 parts (numbers in parens are
	the portion of the original 102 numbered tests that each part got):
	t/lib/t_LKT_Util.pm (zero), t/LKT_00_Compile.t (4), t/LKT_10_MsgProps.t
	(29), t/LKT_20_TrnProps.t (34), t/LKT_30_TrnMsg.t (35).  The test utility
	module t_LKT_Util.pm contains the message() and serialize() functions used
	by most of the other test scripts; the message() function also received a
	minor update such that its output is prefixed with '#' rather than '--',
	like Test::More does for comments.  Also renamed the 4
	t_Locale_KeyedText_*.pm files to t_LKT_*.pm.

	* Updated the new test script t/LKT_00_Compile.t to add 9 brand new numbered
	tests for a total of 13; 6 of these 13 use Test::More's use_ok() function to
	cleanly test that the 1 core module and 5 test modules will load without
	errors; 1 of these tests, with cmp_ok(), that the 1 core module is of the
	correct version; 6 of these test, with can_ok(), that the 5 test modules
	declare the required functions.  This new script runs prior to all of the
	others.  Before this change, the original test script would simply die
	without any ok/not ok.

	* Renamed this file to 'Changes' from 'ChangeLog'; the new name is more
	descriptive to its free-form structure, and more consistent with CPAN (which
	uses both names but 'Changes' seems to be more common these days).  Also
	truncated this Changes file to remove all detail entries for releases v1.00
	thru v1.03; in their place was added a change summary for releases v0.01
	thru v1.03 that mainly just said what the names and versions of all the
	predecessor distributions and modules are.

	* Locale-KeyedText Release 1.03, containing Locale::KeyedText v1.03, was
	released on CPAN.

2004-09-23   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Locale-KeyedText Release 1.00, containing Locale::KeyedText v1.00, was
	released on CPAN.  This is the first release of this module following its
	official registration on the Perl 5 Module List.

2004-09-23   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	The next version of the Module List will list the following module:

	  modid:       Locale::KeyedText
	  DSLIP:       RdpOl
	  description: Refer to user messages in programs by keys
	  userid:      DUNCAND (Darren Duncan)
	  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
	  enteredby:   KSTAR (Kurt D. Starsinic)
	  enteredon:   Thu Sep 23 18:35:01 2004 GMT

	The resulting entry will be:

	Locale::
	::KeyedText       RdpOl Refer to user messages in programs by keys   DUNCAND

	* Locale-KeyedText Release 0.07, containing Locale::KeyedText v0.07, was
	released on CPAN.  This is the last release of this module prior to its
	official registration on the Perl 5 Module List.

2004-01-15   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Locale-KeyedText Release 0.01, containing Locale::KeyedText v0.01, was
	released on CPAN.  This is the first release of any distribution to contain
	Locale::KeyedText.  This is the first release of any distribution for which
	some of the existing work that became the Locale-KeyedText distribution was
	in the form of executable code, and not just design documentation.

2003-09-29   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Began active code development on the proposed Locale::KeyedText module.

	* Module based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

2003-06-03   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Rosetta Release 0.11 was released on CPAN.  This is the first release of
	any distribution where the proposal documentation for Locale::KeyedText uses
	that name for it; it was renamed from Rosetta::Locale.

2003-05-28   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Rosetta Release 0.10 was released on CPAN.  This is the last release of
	any distribution for which the documented name of the proposed module that
	became Locale::KeyedText was given the name Rosetta::Locale.

2003-03-04   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Rosetta Release 0.05 was released on CPAN.  This is the first release of
	any distribution to contain design documentation that became the
	Locale-KeyedText distribution, specifically in the STRUCTURE and BRIEF
	MODULE LIST portions of the documentation file Rosetta::Framework.  It
	described an upcoming new module to make it easy to separate human-readable
	messages from code, intending that each user language can have their own
	separate human text file.  The proposed core module name is Rosetta::Locale.

	* Given that I started publishing details about what became
	Locale::KeyedText here, 2003 is the start of my declared copyright date
	range for Locale::KeyedText.
