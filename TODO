                                   TODO
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following is a summary of things that still need doing.

* BEFORE 2.0.0 RELEASE: ADD STRINGIFY TO as_debug_string() TO REPLACE THE
TRAIT THAT WAS LOST ALONG WITH Class-Std* DROP.

* Update INTERFACE docs to be more like Set::Relation, eg each class gets
an h1 and each method gets an h2.

* Use a more appropriate test for whether a module is loaded; the method
currently used warns as deprecated in more modern Perls (we suppressed it).

* Write the DIAGNOSTICS and other pending documentation in KeyedText.pm,
and write the POD for en.pm, removing sections if not applicable.

* Update translate_message() to properly interpolate variables whose names
include the same characters as variable markers in Template text strings.

* Add support for Template files to be a format other than Pure Perl, such
as plain vanilla tab delimited text files (2 columns: key + string), or
YAML files, or XML files.

* No further updates are planned during the short term except in response
to user requests.
