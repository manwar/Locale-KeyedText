TODO

* Update translate_message() to properly interpolate variables whose names
include the same characters as variable markers in Template text strings.

* Add support for Template files to be a format other than Pure Perl, such
as plain vanilla tab delimited text files (2 columns: key + string) or XML
files.

* Add a new test suite.

* Consider making Locale::KeyedText throw its own exceptions as Message
objects.

* No further updates are planned during the short term except in response
to user requests.
