                                   TODO
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following is a summary of things that still need doing.

* Update INTERFACE docs to be more like Set::Relation, eg each class gets
an h1 and each method gets an h2.

* Consider whether or not we want to add a non-Perl-core external
dependency like Module::Runtime or Class::Load to load template modules
more effectively, whether or not they actually bring any value and behave
correctly for that task, and are worth the dependency weight, or not.

* Write the DIAGNOSTICS and other pending documentation in KeyedText.pm,
and write the POD for en.pm, removing sections if not applicable.

* Update translate_message() to properly interpolate variables whose names
include the same characters as variable markers in Template text strings.

* Add support for Template files to be a format other than Pure Perl, such
as plain vanilla tab delimited text files (2 columns: key + string), or
YAML files, or XML files.

* No further updates are planned during the short term except in response
to user requests.
