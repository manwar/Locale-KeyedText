TODO

* Update the white space of this distribution to follow some best
practices.  This includes having code lines not be longer than 75
characters (like the POD lines).  This and other changes will be
accomplished by running all the code files through perltidy (the first time
I ever use that program, though I was a very consistent formatter before),
which may alter a few other things towards best practices.

* Convert all class objects to be of the inside-out variety rather than
hash-based, so to gain rigorous protection against external code directly
accessing our object attributes, and to avoid related maintenance problems.

* Once the above are done, announce Rosetta/SQL::Routine Developer Release
#4.

* Add official policy for accomodating literal '{' or '}' in Message
variable names; for example, that translate_message() will escape any found
with a '\\' prior to the search'n'replace, and expect that any Template
modules/files will likewise have a '\\{' or '\\}' in them for such variable
names to match for interpolation.

* Add support for Template files to be a format other than Pure Perl, such
as plain vanilla tab delimited text files (2 columns: key + string) or XML
files.

* No further updates are planned during the short term except in response
to user requests.  In the long term, I anticipate that some users may want
more granulated methods in place of translate_message(), such as to debug
which Template files are being tried.  If that describes you, or you have
other needs that are reasonably within the scope of this module's purpose,
then tell me!
