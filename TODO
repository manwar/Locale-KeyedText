                                   TODO
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following is a summary of things that still need doing.

* Update INTERFACE docs to be more like Set::Relation, eg each class gets
an h1 and each method gets an h2.

* Revist how template modules are loaded or tested for already being
loaded.  The current testing method involves treating the symbol table as a
hash and newer Perls give a deprecation warning on that code, which uses
"no strict 'refs';" and "no warnings 'deprecated';".  The current loading
method uses 'eval "require $module_name;";' because it uses the bareword
semantics of "require" so it converts :: to / in module names etc.  On one
hand an ideal solution would be something simple that could be inlined so
no CPAN module dependencies need to be added.  On the other hand, adding a
new dependency on something like Module::Runtime or Class::Load may be
justified even though other dependencies weren't, since it would involve
robust functioning of a core feature and those candidates are mostly free
of non-Core dependencies themselves.

* Write the DIAGNOSTICS and other pending documentation in KeyedText.pm,
and write the POD for en.pm, removing sections if not applicable.

* Update translate_message() to properly interpolate variables whose names
include the same characters as variable markers in Template text strings.

* Add support for Template files to be a format other than Pure Perl, such
as plain vanilla tab delimited text files (2 columns: key + string), or
YAML files, or XML files.

* No further updates are planned during the short term except in response
to user requests.
