TODO

* Update the white space of this distribution to follow some best practices.
This includes having code lines (and POD lines, presumably) not be longer than
80 or 78 characters.  Also run the works through perltidy for the first time as
well (though I was very consistent before), which may alter a few other things
towards best practices.

* Convert all class objects to be of the inside-out variety rather than
hash-based, so to gain rigorous protection against external code directly
accessing our object attributes, and to avoid related maintenance problems.

* Once the above are done, announce Rosetta/SQL::Routine Developer Release #3.

* Add official policy for accomodating literal '{' or '}' in Message variable
names; for example, that translate_message() will escape any found with a '\\'
prior to the search'n'replace, and expect that any Template modules/files will
likewise have a '\\{' or '\\}' in them for such variable names to match for
interpolation.

* Add support for Template files to be a format other than Pure Perl, such as 
plain vanilla tab delimited text files (2 columns: key + string) or XML files.

* No further updates are planned during the short term except in response to
user requests.  In the long term, I anticipate that some users may want more
granulated methods in place of translate_message(), such as to debug which
Template files are being tried.  If that describes you, or you have other needs
that are reasonably within the scope of this module's purpose, then tell me!
