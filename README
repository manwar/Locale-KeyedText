PREFACE

This distribution features the Perl 5 module named "Locale::KeyedText"; see
the file lib/Locale/KeyedText.pm for the main documentation, which is in
POD format, plus the Dependencies and Copyright.  The distribution also
includes a Changes file to say what changes already happened, and a TODO
file to say what changes have yet to happen.  The file INSTALL should help
with installation issues.  The examples/ directory contains several small
programs you can try out and see what Locale::KeyedText can do.  Read below
for how to get support or keep up to date.

KEEPING UP TO DATE

My module set is constantly under development.  The canonical copies are
all linked to through my website, "http://www.DarrenDuncan.net/", on the
page called "Perl Libraries I Made" (name subject to change).

For those of you that are interested in the bleeding edge of development, I
have all parts of this "Locale-KeyedText" distribution in one or more
public Subversion repositories; these repositories only contain revisions
made in mid-2005 and later.  The "Locale-KeyedText" modules exist in 2
distinct code major bases, separated by a ground-up rewrite process.  The
first major code base, whose development had started in late 2003 and ended
as of 2005.09.28, is at "http://svn.utsl.gen.nz/trunk/Rosetta-old/".  The
second major code base, whose development had started on 2005.09.30 and
continues thru to the present, is available in 2 parallel versions at
"http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/ext/Locale-KeyedText/" (Perl 6) and at
"http://svn.utsl.gen.nz/trunk/Locale-KeyedText/" (Perl 5).

You can download slightly older versions of all of my modules from the
public CPAN archives at "http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/D/DU/DUNCAND/", or
on my own web server at "http://www.DarrenDuncan.net/d/perl".

CPAN also extracts the POD from modules and maintains that documentation in
an organized and searchable fashion.  Their main search site is at
"http://search.cpan.org", and my own DUNCAND author page is at
"http://search.cpan.org/search?author=DUNCAND".

You can download my oldest tarred and gzipped distributions from BACKPAN,
at "http://history.perl.org/backpan/authors/id/D/DU/DUNCAND/", or from my
web server, at "http://www.DarrenDuncan.net/d/perl/archives/", right back
to the libdwg 1.0, first released on 2000 July 23.

SUPPORT

Currently I don't have any support arranged with other people, lists,
newsgroups, or otherwise.  Feel free to ask me if you can't figure things
out on your own, or another person whom you know has used this.  I may
start a mailing list for support issues later, so that users of my modules
can help each other with them.

FIN

Share and Enjoy!
